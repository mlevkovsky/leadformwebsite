          <h2>Hey, I'm Mikhael.</h2>
          <h3>Over the last 10 years in the software industry, I've learned how to write clean, robust and scalable code, and I want to show you how to do it.</h3>
          <h3>Along with chapters on fixing common code smells, common bugs and fixes, and common design patterns, you'll get a step by step walkthough on how to build out a Spotify clone, along with the final source code.</h3>
          <h2>No more Foo, Bar, or Baz</h2>
          <h3>It seems that all the examples online follow the same examples of: <span>Foo Bar and Baz</span>. While it makes it general it also makes it impossible to apply to any real world examples.</h3>
          <h3>Anytime I read these examples I find myself thinking: "What's Foo in my case? What the hell is Bar? Where do I put Baz?"</h3>
          <h3>No more decoding what this means and how to translate it to real life code. With this playbook, we'll build a Spotify clone and apply these priciples to real life examples.</h3>
          <h2>Recognize opportunities for design patterns</h2>
          <h3>Applying design patterns is great, if you know how and when to do it. While you may know what a factory or builder is, it's hard to pin point a good opportunity to actually use it.</h3>
          <h3>In this playbook, you'll learn not only about some of the most useful and common design patterns, but more importantly how to spot opportunities to apply them. I'll teach you how to ask the right questions at the right time, to be able to actually use those fancy design patterns you've heard about.</h3>
          <h2>About me</h2>
          <h3>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/mlevkov" target="_blank">@mlevkov</a>, a software developer, blogger and tech enthusiast.</h3>
